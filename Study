Multi-threading with streams

Stream API simplifies multithreadaing by providing
the parallelStream() method that runs operations over stream's elements in
parallel mode.
The code below allows to run method doWork() in parallel for every element of
the stream:

list.parallelStream().forEach(element -> doWork(element));
